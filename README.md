# CI/CD Pipeline for GCP Infrastructure

This project sets up a CI/CD Bitbucket pipeline to automatically deploy Terraform-managed resources to a Google Cloud Platform (GCP) environment. It uses separate feature and master branches to handle different stages of the validation, planning, and deployment steps securely.

---

## ðŸ“¦ Features

- Defined GCP provider configuration in the provider.tf with project, region and credentials parameters
- Bitbucket CI/CD pipeline to deploy Terraform managed resource to GCP platform
- Terraform linting with `tflint` and Checkov `checkov` for validation & security scanning
- `feature` branch performs the lintin/checkov checks for validation & security scanning. This is followed by Terraform plan to allow for resource changes to be reviewed by peers in a pull-request before any deployments are made.
- `master` branch performs the Terraform linting, Terraform plan and Terraform apply step using -auto-approve flag to deploy the changes to the target GCP account.  
- Pipeline uses `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variables to securely authenticate to the GCP account avoiding using hardcoded credentials.
